# Google Retail Search 

## PHP Samples

The code here demonstrates how you can consume Google Retail Search from PHP.

### Before you can run

#### Authorization

In order to authenticate and authorize the NodeJS runtime environment with the Retail Search server,
place a JSON file with credentials and refer environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to it (see examples in code)

```
// TODO: add a code example 
```

#### Installation 

To install all the dependancies, copy the library to a subfolder called `vendor`

### Running the code samples

To execute an individual code sample, envoke `php` with a file as a parameter at the command line prompt, e.g.:

```
cd retail-search-php-samples
php catalog_service.php 
```
